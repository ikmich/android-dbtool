#Dbtool(s)
===========================

-> understand what it means to upgrade an sqlite db
-> understand how an alter query command would work and how to apply it to Dbtool
-> how to create class or resource links in javadoc??
-> how to export javadoc

-> read about throwing exceptions and how and when to use them.
-> re-include the table(...) methods for Dbtool and DbtoolActionUnit... ?


#handled?
-> rework the logic for createDb(), to cater for when the database already exists. 
e.g. if the user calls createDb(dbname, actionOnCreate), and the database is already 
existing, what should become of the actionOnCreate, since this is intended to 
represent an action that should be run when the database is created. ideally, if the 
database exists, and user calls createDb(dbname, actionOnCreate), it's actionOnOpen that 
should be run instead... so how do you apply this new direction?...


#uncertain?
-> re-include the insert() method, but make private for internal use?
